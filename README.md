# book-picture-dewarping
Software to dewarp book picture images, and for building models of ruled surfaces

This code here was produced during my internship at Google in 2011. Unfortunately the project is not very well structured, not very usable, and I also don't have the necessary data to run examples. The code is free, but the data I used to develop it was not. But here it is as a reference, some day someone might pick it up again.

I have actually continued the project in a different direction, I am now trying to dewarp text images straight from the image, no other data such as 3D points necessary. But it's still in progress, and I haven't made it public yet.
